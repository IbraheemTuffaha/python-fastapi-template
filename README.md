# Python FastAPI Template

A template for a Python FastAPI service:
- [x] [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for dependency management
- [x] [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for building the API
- [x] [Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) for development environment
- [x] [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization
- [x] [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) & [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for code formatting
- [x] [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for code quality checks
- [x] [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD
- [ ] [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing (TODO: add tests)
- [ ] [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) for deployment (TODO: add Kamal deploy action)
